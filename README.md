# LinkedIn Map Header
### Quick R code to create a custom LinkedIn header (or full size image) using open street maps in R.

NOTE: This code was heavily borrowed (HEAVILY BORROWED) from http://joshuamccrain.com/tutorials/maps/streets_tutorial.html.

I encountered this tutorial in my early stages in R, while looking for a package for creating interactive maps for a class project at Nashville Software School (Leaflet was obviously the correct solution, but like I said - it was very early stages in R). While I didn't end up using this product in my final project, I always wanted an excuse to use it because I love the clean, beautiful lines of the map. 

If you want to make a map for your own city, it should be a very simple process to replicate. For a more detailed tutorial, definitely check out Joshua's website. He also provides information on how to add some fun details to your map (like highlighting specific roads or adding a layer of markers for something of interest to you). If anything, for me it was a jolt of excitement at a moment where I was feeling lost and unsure of my footing.

If you end up using this, I'd be thrilled if you sent me a message for to check out your handiwork!
